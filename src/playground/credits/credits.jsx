            <p>
                More than 100 people have helped translate TurboWarp and its addons into many languages —
                far more than we could hope to list here.
            </p>
            <p>
                PenguinMod is also (very very slowly) getting translated into other languages, in the future
                hopefully the same number of languages can be supported. It'll take a while until we get there though.
